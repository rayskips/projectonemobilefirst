   <p class="Goals">
I'm Rachael! I am in my first quarter of the VCD major at EWU. I work at a small real estate company called Haven as the Marketing and Listings Manager. I decided to go back to school and pursue this degree because I love when I get to work on creative tasks. One of my goals in this major is to learn the techincal side of design, so that I can make the ideas I have in my head a reality. I am hoping that this will open the door to more opportunities to do what I love for work!
    
     <br> <br>
     
     When I'm not in school or at work I love to spend time with my family. One of my favorite things to do is to take weekend trips with my husband to the mountains and try out new hikes or old favorites. I am definitely happiest when I am out in nature! 

     <br>  <br>
     
Large goals have always been hard for me to lay out. Maybe one of my goals should be to evaluate where I want to go, and to set more small goals to get me there! 
    
     In the short(ish) term, I would like to graduate and use the skills that I learn in my work. I would like to get more experience and practice with digital photography. In the long term, I would love to be a part of a company where I feel like the work is making a difference in people's lives. I would also like a career that allows me to have a family and to be creative.

  <h3>My Favorite Meals</h3>

  <p>
  <h4>Smoothies</h4>Do smoothies technically count as a meal? Oh well, still one of my favorites! Creamy, cold, and fill them with anything you want. One of my personal favorites is: <ul> <li>Frozen Bananas</li>
  <li>Dates</li>
  <li>Handful of Spinach</li>
  <li>Pinch of Nutmeg</li>
  <li>Mint Leaves</li>
  </ul>
  So simple and SOOO tasty. If only mine looked as pretty as the picture...

   <h4>Curry </h4>
   Mmmm curry. Just thinking about it makes me happy. Another super versatile food; you can have it green, yellow, red, spicy, not spicy...There are so many possibilities! Personally, I like mine yellow, with a coconut milk base, and TONSSS of veggies.    </p>

 <p>
   <h4>Sushi</h4>
   Now this one might not be for everyone, but it is easily one of my all-time favorite foods. So fresh and so filling, sushi is perfect for lunch or dinner! My husband and I don't know how to make it, so it is often one of our date-night go-to's. My favorite is the "Cherry Blossom Roll" from Sushi.com. It has this really unique creamy wasabi sauce on it that I love!

  <h3>My Favorite Book</h3>	

 <A HREF="https://www.amazon.com/East-Penguin-Twentieth-Century-Classics/dp/0140186395"><IMG class="book" SRC="https://grumpajoesplace.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img.jpg"></A> 
	
 <p>  
  East of Eden is definitely one of my favorite books. I love it because it tells the story of several different groups of people and you don't find out how all of their stories relate until the end. Steinbeck uses beautiful imagery in it, and really delves into who the characters are and why they are the way they are. It also has just enough mystery to keep it exciting.
